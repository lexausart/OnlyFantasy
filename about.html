                    Tian Peng is a tamawo, a Filipino creature similar to a Moogle and fairy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Tamawo are very territorial and express their feelings by throwing objects such as dirt, flowers, or
                    stones.
                    <br>
                    Of course, she loves her family! Fortunata sends motiviational packages and postcards to Da Qi and
                    Tian Peng while she's out researching.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A tamawo is made when another tamawo kidnaps a child and feeds a child their food. It is up to
                    interpretation on the legitimacy of her family life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her best friend is <a href="https://FFXIV.Lexa.us">Sunny</a> and she teases her by shape-shifting
                    into Sunny's wife, <a href="https://FFXIV.Lexa.us">Blaire</a>.

                <h2>Fortunata Peng</h2>
                <h3>Tuna, for short</h3>
                <p class=" w3-large w3-text-pink">Discord: Saltamiya#5905

                <p>
                    Fortunata Peng is an aswang, a Filipino creature akin to a shape-shifting vampire.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Aswang differ based on ethnolinguistic groups in the Philippines but Fortunata has a long, red,
                    thread-like tongue she keeps hidden by speaking with few words.
                    <br>
                    She takes the form of what she wants at will. At the moment she makes sure to look attractive to her
                    wife, Tian.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    An aswang from her specific ethnolinguistic group also displays characteristics of a manananggal, in
                    which she can separate her torso with entrails hanging out from the bottom half of her body and fly
                    around.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As Da Qi doesn't have a father figure in his life, she dons a moustache to assert masculinity.
                    Eventually she hopes to fill the void of other family figures as well, such as sister, brother,
                    aunt, uncle, cousin, and so forth.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her favorite food is corpses with her favorite drink being blood. As a father figure to Da, she has
                    shed this aspect of her life to the best of her ability and enables him to live a completely
                    "normal" life.
